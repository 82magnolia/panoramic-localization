# Panoramic Localization
Panoramic localization library containing PyTorch implementations of various panoramic localization algorithms.
The codebase for LDL has been released, and we will release the source code for CPO and PICCOLO in due time.
The instructions for setup and running the codebase will also be released in a few days (we are having some delays due to the Korean national holiday Chuseok ðŸ˜…).
